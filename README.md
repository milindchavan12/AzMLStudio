# Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning:
Machine learning allows it to take existing data, analyze it to identify patterns, and use the results to make better predictions about new data.

The Azure Machine Learning Studio is a great tool for doing data science with a visual interface. It is also a great tool for acquiring, cleaning, and transforming data.
